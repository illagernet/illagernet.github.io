    <p>Used to shorten a dead players ban time
    <h4>Usage Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Construct rune using 9 obisdian, 4 netherrack, 1 chest, and 1 conduit as shown in figures. Orientation does not matter. Light the netherrack.
      <li>Name a piece of paper to match the target player's username. Place the named piece of paper in the chest. Multiple player names may be placed in the chest together.
      <li>Right click the conduit with a diamond. The diamond will be consumed. In exchange, an hour will be removed from a target player's ban. 
    </ol>
    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A valid "target" is any death-banned player. It is ineffective to target players banned by moderation.
      <li>If no valid target is found in the chest, the netherrack pillars will burn out. Using this mechanic, you can safely determine when a player's ban has been lifted.
      <li>If multiple valid targets are listed in the chest, players will be targetted in the order they appear in the chest.
    </ul>
    <h3>Other Runes</h3>
    <p>More runes to come soon! In the works are:
    <ul>
      <li>Immutability rune, to create grief-free zones
      <li>Pocketing rune, to establish gateways to addressed pocket dimensions. Useful for storage and fast-travel
      <li>Proximity rune, to alert players of intruders. Will have optional Discord integration!
      <li>Jamming rune, to disrupt other runes. Will have a several-hours long charge up time, to allow defending players to prepare.
      <li>Destruction rune, to rapidly break large patches of blocks. Useful for terraforming, but too expensive for mining. 
    </ul>
    <p>And if you have an idea for another rune, pitch to us in the <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/609524243385942056/609784546551922690">Discord #feedback channel</a>.
